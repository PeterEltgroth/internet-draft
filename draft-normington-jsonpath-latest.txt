1.  Introduction

   JSONPath was introduced by Stefan Goessner as a simple form of XPath
   for JSON.  See his original article [Goessner].

   JSON is defined by RFC 8259 [RFC8259].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  ABNF Syntax

   The syntax in this document conforms to ABNF as defined by RFC 5234
   [RFC5234].

2.  JSONPath Syntax and Semantics

2.1.  Node Matching Semantics

   A JSONPath is a string which matches zero or more nodes of any JSON
   document.

   A JSONPath is abstractly a sequence of matchers.  Each matcher takes
   a list of nodes and produces a possibly different list of nodes.  The
   initial list of nodes, consisting of just the root node of a given
   JSON document, is passed to the first matcher of the sequence.  The
   output from each matcher is passed to the next matcher in the
   sequence, and so forth until the end of the sequence is reached.  The
   list of nodes produced by the last matcher is the result of matching
   the JSONPath to the given JSON document.

   If the JSONPath is empty, this correspondds to an empty sequence of
   matchers and matches the root node of the JSON document.  That is,
   the result is a list consisting of just the root node of the JSON
   document.

   As a consequence, if any of the matchers matches no nodes, then the
   whole JSONPath matches no nodes.

   The semantics of each matcher are defined for each type of node.
   Each node holds a JSON value (as defined by RFC 8259 [RFC8259]), that
   is, an object, array, number, string, or one of the literals "true",
   "false", or "null".

2.1.1.  Basics

   JSONPaths start by matching the root node of a JSON document.  There
   is an explicit notation "$" for a matcher which matches just the root
   node:

   path = root subpath ;
   root = %x24         ; $ matches the root node of a document

   subpath = identity  ; see below for alternatives
   identity = ""       ; matches all input nodes

   Valid JSONPaths MUST conform to the grammar of "path".

3.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

   All drafts are required to have an IANA considerations section (see
   Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs
   [RFC5226] for a guide).  If the draft does not require IANA to do
   anything, the section contains an explicit statement that this is the
   case (as above).  If there are no requirements for IANA, the section
   will be removed during conversion into an RFC by the RFC Editor.

4.  Security Considerations

   This section gives security considerations, as required by RFC 3552
   [RFC3552].

5.  Alternatives

   An analogous standard, JSON Pointer, is provided by RFC 6901
   [RFC6901].
