1.  Introduction

   JSONPath was introduced by Stefan Goessner as a simple form of XPath
   for JSON.  See his original article [Goessner].

   JSON is defined by RFC 8259 [RFC8259].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  ABNF Syntax

   The syntax in this document conforms to ABNF as defined by RFC 5234
   [RFC5234].

2.  JSONPath Syntax and Semantics

3.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

   All drafts are required to have an IANA considerations section (see
   Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs
   [RFC5226] for a guide).  If the draft does not require IANA to do
   anything, the section contains an explicit statement that this is the
   case (as above).  If there are no requirements for IANA, the section
   will be removed during conversion into an RFC by the RFC Editor.

4.  Security Considerations

   This section gives security considerations, as required by RFC 3552
   [RFC3552].

5.  Alternatives

   An analogous standard, JSON Pointer, is provided by RFC 6901
   [RFC6901].
